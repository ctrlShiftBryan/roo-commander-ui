# Task Q&A

**Q1:** The main usage of `fileScanner` appears to be within `app/routes/_index.tsx`. Is this the specific page you want to replace entirely with the simple "Hello World" dashboard?
**A1:** Yes, replace the entire content of `app/routes/_index.tsx` with the "Hello World" dashboard.

**Q2:** Since we are removing `app/lib/fileScanner.ts`, should we also delete the corresponding test file `app/lib/fileScanner.test.ts`?
**A2:** Yes, delete `app/lib/fileScanner.test.ts` as it's no longer needed.

**Q3:** The "Hello World" dashboard page - should it have any specific styling or layout, or just plain text?
**A3:** Make it a large header styled with Tailwind.

**Q4:** Are there any other files or components that might be indirectly affected by removing `fileScanner.ts` or replacing `_index.tsx` that I should be aware of? (e.g., shared components, routing configurations)
**A4:** User doesn't think so. Checked `app/root.tsx` and `app/routes.ts`; no direct dependencies found. Changes seem isolated.

**Q5:** Are there any other related cleanup tasks you'd like included in the plan? For example, removing unused imports or variables that might be left over in `_index.tsx` before replacing it? (Though replacing the whole file makes this less likely).
**A5:** Yes, run a linter/formatter after the changes to ensure code quality.
