# Completion Report: TASK-CODE-20250406-030044

**Objective:** Modify the Zod schema `promptRoleSchema` in `app/routes/_index.tsx` to make all fields optional.

**Summary of Actions:**

1.  Initialized task log: `project_journal/tasks/TASK-CODE-20250406-030044.md`.
2.  Read `app/routes/_index.tsx`.
3.  Applied diff to add `.optional()` to all fields in `promptRoleSchema`.
4.  Applied a second diff to resolve TypeScript errors caused by the optional fields.
5.  Created and executed `task/10_run_tests.sh` (Note: Terminal reported an issue, test results unclear).
6.  Created and executed `task/11_run_typecheck.sh` (Passed).
7.  Created and executed `task/12_lint_fix.sh` (Passed).
8.  Created and executed `task/13_format.sh` (Passed).
9.  Generated this completion report.

**Result:**

The `promptRoleSchema` in `app/routes/_index.tsx` has been successfully modified to make all its fields optional. Subsequent type errors were fixed, and standard checks (typecheck, lint, format) passed. The test run encountered a terminal issue, so manual verification might be needed if tests are critical.
