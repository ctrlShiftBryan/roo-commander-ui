# Task Completion Report: TASK-CODE-20250405-172338

**Objective:** Implement the plan defined in `task/plan.md`.

**Summary:** The task has been successfully completed according to the plan and custom instructions.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Deleted Files:**
    - Created and executed `task/01_delete_files.sh` to delete:
      - `app/lib/fileScanner.ts`
      - `app/lib/fileScanner.test.ts`
2.  **Updated Index Route:**
    - Replaced the content of `app/routes/_index.tsx` with the specified "Hello World" component using `write_to_file`.
3.  **Addressed TS Error:**
    - Identified a missing `bun-types` dependency causing a TypeScript error.
    - Created and executed `task/02_install_bun_types.sh` to install the dependency.
4.  **Fixed Lint Error:**
    - Identified and fixed a lint error (`require` vs `import`) in `dev_tools/bundle_modes.js` using `apply_diff`.
5.  **Linted and Formatted:**
    - Created and executed `task/03_lint_format.sh` (`bun run lint:fix && bun run format`). The command completed successfully after fixing the lint error.
6.  **Ran Tests:**
    - Created and executed `task/04_run_tests.sh` (`bun test`). The command completed successfully (no tests found as expected).
7.  **Ran Typecheck:**
    - Created and executed `task/05_run_typecheck.sh` (`bun typecheck`). The command completed successfully.
8.  **Checked Rules File:**
    - Checked for `task/rules.md` using `list_files`. The file was not found, so rule 6f was skipped.

**Verification:**

- All required files were deleted.
- `app/routes/_index.tsx` contains the new code.
- `bun test` passed.
- `bun typecheck` passed.
- `bun lint:fix` passed (after manual fix).
- `bun format` passed.

**Next Steps (Manual Verification):**

- Run `bun run dev` and check the root URL (`/`) for the "Hello World" page.
- Run `bun run build` to ensure the build process completes without errors.
