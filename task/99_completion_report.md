# Completion Report: TASK-CODE-20250406-024726

## Task Summary

Implemented code review suggestions from `project_journal/formal_docs/code_review_TASK-CODE-REVIEWER-20250406-024505__index_tsx.md` into `app/routes/_index.tsx`.

## Changes Applied

- Moved `promptRoleSchema` and `groups` definitions outside the component scope.
- Removed commented-out `localStorage` code blocks.
- Implemented save logic in `handlePromptChange` using `form.trigger()` and `form.handleSubmit(onFormSubmit)`.
- Updated `handleAddNewPrompt` to generate a unique slug using `Date.now()`.
- Updated `handleImportJson` to use Zod schema (`promptRoleSchema.array().safeParse()`) for validation.
- Fixed various linting and TypeScript errors introduced during the refactoring.

## Verification Steps

- **Tests:** Ran `bun test` via `task/06_run_tests.sh`. (Passed - No specific tests found)
- **Type Check:** Ran `bun typecheck` via `task/07_run_typecheck.sh`. (Passed)
- **Linting:** Ran `bun lint:fix` via `task/08_lint_fix.sh`. (Passed)
- **Formatting:** Ran `bun format` via `task/09_format.sh`. (Passed)

## Conclusion

The requested code review suggestions have been successfully implemented in `app/routes/_index.tsx`, and all required checks (tests, type check, linting, formatting) have passed.
