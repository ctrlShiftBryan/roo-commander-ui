# Task Log: TASK-BUGFIX-PROMPTEDITOR-TESTS-20250406-044800 - Bug Fix: Failing PromptEditor Tests

**Goal:** Investigate and fix failing tests in `app/features/prompt-editor/components/PromptEditor.test.tsx` caused by recent refactoring.

**Investigation (2025-04-06 04:48 AM):**

- Reviewed refactoring log (`project_journal/tasks/TASK-REFACTOR-20250406-043712.md`).
- Test failure identified: `AggregateError` from `@testing-library/react/dist/act-compat.js` in test 'should render without errors and display the main title' (line 61 of `PromptEditor.test.tsx`).
- Cause likely related to unhandled async state updates from refactored hooks (`usePromptManagement`, `usePromptForm`, `usePromptImportExport`).

**Diagnosis (2025-04-06 04:48 AM):**

- Examined `PromptEditor.test.tsx`.
- The failing test `should render without errors...` calls `render(<PromptEditor />);` (line 61), triggering the `act` error.
- Root cause: Asynchronous state updates likely occurring within the refactored custom hooks (`usePromptManagement`, `usePromptForm`, `usePromptImportExport`) immediately upon component mount, which are not awaited or handled by the test's `act()` wrapper during the initial render.
- Solution: Mock the custom hooks used by `PromptEditor` in the test setup to provide synchronous, controlled return values, isolating the component for this render test.

**Verification Attempt 1 (2025-04-06 04:51 AM):**

- **Action:** Updated test to use `async`/`await` with `findByText`.
- **Command:** `bun test app/features/prompt-editor/components/PromptEditor.test.tsx`
- **Outcome:** ❌ Failed
- **Error:** `TypeError: Failed to execute 'dispatchEvent' on 'EventTarget': parameter 1 is not of type 'Event'.` (Originating from JSDOM / Radix UI Checkbox interaction).

**Verification Attempt 2 (2025-04-06 04:52 AM):**

- **Action:** Added `global.Event = dom.window.Event;` to `tests/setup.ts` to address the `dispatchEvent` error.
- **Command:** `bun test app/features/prompt-editor/components/PromptEditor.test.tsx`
- **Outcome:** ✅ Passed

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Fixed failing test `should render without errors and display the main title` in `app/features/prompt-editor/components/PromptEditor.test.tsx`. The initial `act` error was bypassed using `async/await findByText`, which then revealed a `dispatchEvent` error. This was resolved by adding `global.Event = dom.window.Event;` to the JSDOM setup in `tests/setup.ts`.
**Root Cause:** Missing `Event` global definition in the JSDOM test environment setup (`tests/setup.ts`), causing issues with event handling in dependencies (Radix UI).
**References:** [`tests/setup.ts` (modified), `app/features/prompt-editor/components/PromptEditor.test.tsx` (modified)]

- **Analysis:** The `async` change revealed an underlying incompatibility between a dependency (likely Radix UI Checkbox used within a sub-component) and the JSDOM test environment's event handling.
