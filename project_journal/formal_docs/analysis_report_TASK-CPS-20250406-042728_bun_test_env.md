# Analysis Report: TASK-CPS-20250406-042728 - Bun Test Environment Fix for React Components

**Date:** 2025-04-06
**Author:** Roo Complex Problem Solver

## 1. Problem Statement

The Bun test runner (`bun test`) failed to execute the React component test located at `app/features/prompt-editor/components/PromptEditor.test.tsx`. The primary error encountered was `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: document`, originating from `@testing-library/react`'s `render` function. This occurred despite having "DOM" in `tsconfig.json`'s `lib` and preloading `tests/setup.ts` via `bunfig.toml`. Attempts using the `--dom` flag had also previously failed.

**Goal:** Configure the Bun test environment to successfully run React component tests using `@testing-library/react`, specifically resolving the missing DOM globals issue.

## 2. Analysis Performed

1.  **Configuration Review:**
    - `bunfig.toml`: Confirmed `preload = ["./tests/setup.ts"]` under `[test]` was correctly configured.
    - `tests/setup.ts`: Initially only contained imports for Bun's test globals (`describe`, `it`, etc.) and lacked any DOM environment setup.
    - `tsconfig.json`: Presence of `"lib": ["DOM", ...]` confirmed TypeScript awareness of DOM types, but this doesn't provide a runtime environment.
2.  **Initial Hypothesis:** The test environment lacked a runtime DOM (like JSDOM), which is required by `@testing-library/react`. The `preload` mechanism was working, but the setup file wasn't initializing the DOM.
3.  **Attempt 1 (Bun Built-in DOM):**
    - **Action:** Added `browser = true` to `bunfig.toml` under `[test]`.
    - **Result:** Failed with the same `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: document`.
    - **Conclusion:** Bun's built-in DOM environment (via config or `--dom` flag) was not activating or functioning correctly in this project setup.
4.  **Attempt 2 (Manual JSDOM Setup):**
    - **Action:** Installed `jsdom` and `@types/jsdom`. Modified `tests/setup.ts` to create a `JSDOM` instance and assign `window`, `document`, `navigator`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `HTMLElement`, `HTMLAnchorElement`, `FileReader`, and `URL` to the global scope.
    - **Result:** Failed with `AggregateError:` from `@testing-library/react/dist/act-compat.js`. The `document` error was resolved.
    - **Conclusion:** JSDOM was partially working, but an issue related to React's `act` or async updates emerged.
5.  **Attempt 3 (Async/Await Test):**
    - **Action:** Modified the test case to use `async () => { await render(...); }`.
    - **Result:** Failed with `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: getComputedStyle` from `@radix-ui/react-presence`.
    - **Conclusion:** The `act` error was potentially masked or resolved, but revealed another missing global required by a dependency (Radix UI).
6.  **Attempt 4 (Add `getComputedStyle`):**
    - **Action:** Added `global.getComputedStyle = dom.window.getComputedStyle;` to `tests/setup.ts`.
    - **Result:** Failed with `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: DocumentFragment` and `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: ResizeObserver` from Radix UI components.
    - **Conclusion:** More globals required by dependencies were missing from the JSDOM setup.
7.  **Attempt 5 (Add `DocumentFragment`, `ResizeObserver`):**
    - **Action:** Added `global.DocumentFragment = dom.window.DocumentFragment;` and `global.ResizeObserver = dom.window.ResizeObserver;` to `tests/setup.ts`.
    - **Result:** Failed with `TypeError: undefined is not a constructor (evaluating 'new ResizeObserver(...)')`.
    - **Conclusion:** JSDOM's native `ResizeObserver` implementation was insufficient or incompatible.
8.  **Attempt 6 (Use `ResizeObserver` Polyfill):**
    - **Action:** Installed `resize-observer-polyfill`. Modified `tests/setup.ts` to import and assign the polyfill to `global.ResizeObserver`.
    - **Result:** âœ… Success! The test passed.
    - **Conclusion:** The combination of manual JSDOM setup with explicit global assignments and a dedicated polyfill for `ResizeObserver` provided the necessary environment.

## 3. Root Cause

The root cause of the initial `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: document` was the absence of a DOM environment during test execution. Bun's built-in DOM environment (`--dom` flag or `browser = true` in `bunfig.toml`) failed to activate or function correctly in this specific project configuration. Subsequent errors revealed that a manual JSDOM setup requires explicitly assigning numerous browser globals (`window`, `document`, `navigator`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `getComputedStyle`, `DocumentFragment`, `HTMLElement`, etc.) and potentially using polyfills for complex APIs like `ResizeObserver` that dependencies might rely on and which JSDOM's implementation might not fully cover or expose correctly.

## 4. Solution Implemented

1.  Installed `jsdom`, `@types/jsdom`, and `resize-observer-polyfill` as development dependencies.
2.  Modified `tests/setup.ts` (preloaded via `bunfig.toml`) to:
    - Import `JSDOM` and `ResizeObserver` from the polyfill.
    - Create a `JSDOM` instance.
    - Explicitly assign necessary properties from the JSDOM `window` object to the `global` scope (`window`, `document`, `navigator`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `getComputedStyle`, `DocumentFragment`, `HTMLElement`, `HTMLAnchorElement`, `FileReader`, `URL`).
    - Assign the imported `ResizeObserver` polyfill to `global.ResizeObserver`.

## 5. Recommendation Summary

The recommended and implemented solution is to manually configure a JSDOM environment within the `tests/setup.ts` file, ensuring all necessary browser globals required by React, Testing Library, and component dependencies (like Radix UI) are explicitly assigned to the `global` scope. This includes using polyfills like `resize-observer-polyfill` where JSDOM's native implementations are insufficient. This approach provides explicit control and avoids reliance on potentially unstable or incompatible built-in features of the test runner.
